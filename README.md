# Adding a Little Shiny Power to an Online Racing League

Presentation at the Appsilon Shiny Conference (April 2022)

Abstract: As we approach Shiny's tenth year in the R community, we have seen many  applications bring the full spectrum of data science workflows across many industries and situations. Little did I predict that a friendly gathering of fellow technology and gaming enthusiasts would lead to a completely over-engineered data pipeline. In this talk, I share how a suite of Shiny apps with real-time data extraction, random car selections, and stylized dashboards add a little extra fuel to an entertaining online racing league with many unexpected twists and laughs throughout.
