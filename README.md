# How Shiny Fueled Online Racing League

This repository contains the slides and other materials for my presentation at the Appsilon Shiny Conference (April 27-29. 2022). The slides have been created using the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) publishing system and the development environment is fully containerized with Docker, using my template repository at [github.com/rpodcast/r_dev_projects](https://github.com/rpodcast/r_dev_projects). The slides can be viewed at [rpodcast.github.io/shinyracing](https://rpodcast.github.io/shinyracing).

Abstract: As we approach Shiny's tenth year in the R community, we have seen many  applications bring the full spectrum of data science workflows across many industries and situations. Little did I predict that a friendly gathering of fellow technology and gaming enthusiasts would lead to a completely over-engineered data pipeline. In this talk, I share how a suite of Shiny apps with real-time data extraction, random car selections, and stylized dashboards add a little extra fuel to an entertaining online racing league with many unexpected twists and laughs throughout.
